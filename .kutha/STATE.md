# Kutha harness state

**Lease** of process intent + last fold — not process SoT. Process SoT (H0) is `.kutha/events.jsonl` (gitignored observations). Product SoT is the event log (D1): sealed `KUTHASEG` segments plus `manifest.json`, with legacy `events.jsonl` + `events.wal` until `store::migrate`; `crates/kutha-runtime` folds it. `events.jsonl` after migrate is an export. Not an ADR.

**STCA plane:** Space = check slices; Time = harness JSONL; Composition = `--budget`.

**Active Milestone:** M153
**Active Slice:** S01
**Phase:** H5

| Lifecycle | Current | Must not read as |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| L_map | ADR-000–002 and 010–093 are **Proposed** | Product ready / Accepted |
| L_delivery | M153-S01 leased (v1.47): Verus on-ramp, first proof `vt_intersect` | Capability proven / Cypher started |
| L_capability | FF5 green (`as_of(2015) ≠ as_of(2021)` on statute fixture) | Governor CI green |

## Next action

M153 S01 (Verus on-ramp): pin the Verus release (`tools/verus/`), add `verus/vt_intersect.rs` (production body verbatim plus soundness and completeness contract), and one governor check `verus-proof-sync` that pins the proof body to `crates/kutha-runtime/src/fold.rs`. This is the single harness row the slice's own invariant needs (moratorium exception: a check pinning an invariant introduced by a product slice). No runner, no `observe` kind, no CI dependency on Verus; the proof run is recorded evidence, not a gate. Then B1 (ADR-012 thin vacuum with receipt) stays the first Arc B candidate. Honeycomb stays Proposed. Not Cypher/HNSW until their milestones are leased; `I-legal-pack-not-next` stays. Not a hard FSM (ADR-000 D3).

## Thaw map

The freeze list came from agent-assisted commits (`1ee5942`, `85db1f7`, 2026-08-18, Cursor co-authored); the owner states he did not decide it. M002 is thawed (2026-10-03, owner's request). Every other item keeps its own named gate; nothing is thawed by "an M002 lease".

| Item | Thaws when |
|------|------------|
| RocksDB crate | Thawed (Phase 51/55): optional dependency `rocksdb` in kutha-runtime only; `freeze-rocks` is a durable rule (optional dependencies only) |
| Cypher/GPML parser | M003 is leased |
| HNSW | M005 is leased |
| ADR-050 six dictionaries | SIX-01 is leased |
| ADR-080/081 | a security milestone is leased (after M003) |
| full ADR-090 ontology | STATE names a legal pack (`I-legal-pack-not-next`) |
| ADR-093 | a science pack is leased (M004) |
| Consensus Query 103+ | the owner lifts the literature bound |
